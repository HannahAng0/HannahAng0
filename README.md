## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My names Hannah Ang, currently taking BSCS.  
I am a aspiring web developer and game developer.
I created this github to store some of collaboration projects from school and also my personal projects!

I want to expand my knowledge and my skills, so if you have some time, you can check my portfolio or repositories and suggest things that i can improve!

Thank you so much!
